I've used a Keyword driven framework for automation testing.
Here,this project will run in IDE Intelli j version 2020 . 
There is some methods in KeywordEngine and some keywords in Keyword service.Expand KWD TOTP in IDE -> Target -> classes -> com -> disinnovators -> keyword -> driven -> engine -> KeywordEngine and Expand KWD TOTP in IDE -> Target -> classes -> com -> disinnovators -> keyword -> driven -> service -> Keyword service .Also Expand KWD TOTP in IDE -> build ->config -> Project_Properties ,here you have to provide folder location of your project in line 1,7,8,64 .Also Expand KWD TOTP in IDE ->Test script -> Pom file, here is the pom file.
There's an excel file in the project Final -> KWD ->Test script folder.Opening this excel file you'll find xpath and keywords.This keywords are called from class Keywordservice,where methods are written.Methods are written in Java.
To run this file goto intelli j -> open the project in IDE ->click "Run" button.In the console you can see which line is paased and which is failed. 
After finishing running this project you can see the report that how many have passes/failed.To get the report : Final -> KWD ->Test script folder-> Double click on Chrome report and observe. It will also show you why your test case failed.
Also i'm attaching a demo video to understand what i did.
I've covered here : Navigating to website, Registration,Placing order and confirming, Updating Name, Logout.
