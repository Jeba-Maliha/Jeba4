I've used a Keyword driven framework for automation testing.
Here,this project will run in IDE Intelli j version 2020 . 
There is some methods in Keywordservice and some keywords in Keyword engine. 
There's an excel file in the project Final -> KWD ->Test script folder.Opening this folder you'll find xpath and keywords.This keywords are called from class Keywordservice,where methods are written.Methods are written in Java.
To run this file goto intelli j ->click "Run" button.In the console you can see which line is paased and which is failed. 
After finishing running this project you can see the report that how many have passes/failed.To get the report : Final -> KWD ->Test script folder-> Double click on Chrome report.
Also i'm attaching a demo video to understand what i did.
